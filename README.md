## Project Overview

This analysis of CitiBike's bikesharing program in NYC is provided as research for a similar program in Des Moines, Iowa, and aims to determine the feasibility of such a buisness. Looking at data on numbers of bikes, numbers of trips, peak times of travel, types of customers, trip duration, and bike use/lifecycle will be useful in comparing the potential population needs of another program in another city and perhaps identify potential differences in use as well as budget requirements.

The inspiration for this business proposal is based on the personal experience of the presenters, who feel their most recent trip to NYC was highly enhanced by the bikesharing business there.
