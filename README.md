## Project Overview

This analysis of CitiBike's bikesharing program in NYC is provided as research for a similar program in Des Moines, Iowa, and aims to determine the feasibility of such a buisness. Looking at data on numbers of bikes, numbers of trips, peak times of travel, types of customers, trip duration, and bike use/lifecycle will be useful in comparing the potential population needs of another program in another city and perhaps identify potential differences in customer use as well as highlight budget requirements.

The inspiration for this business proposal is based on the personal experience of the presenters, who feel their most recent trip to NYC was highly enhanced by the bikesharing business there.

## Results

The total trips included in the dataset used for this analysis is 2,344,224 trips. Users had the option to be "subscribers" or anonymous users. Gender appears to have been known for all subscribers and use specific to gender was therefore also analyzed.

Fig. 1, above, shows frequency of trip durations. Trip duration peaks in frequency at 5 minutes and then drops off steeply with very few trips longer than 45 minutes.

Fig. 2, above, shows trip duration frequency separated by gender.  Female and unknown-gendered riders account for roughly one third of the rides while male riders account for two thirds.

Fig. 3, above, hightlights peak service times for all users. Peak user times are weekdays from 8-9am & 5-7pm, with two exceptions: wednesday evenings are unusally slow, and friday evenings end earlier.

This chart reveals that the majority of users are male subscribers, using bikes most often on evenings, especially Thursday evening.

## Summary
This analysis highlights several key items to research for comparison in cities wishing to start a similar program...
